**AUTOMATED TEST GENERATION SYSTEM**

This is a hackathon project that me and a few of my friends built. Since we had to built this within 12 hours it still
incomplete and a bit messy. But i will fix that in future maybe, lmao.

***working***
this web app aims in creatug a test system ( similar to google forms ) using an excel file that 
contains details regarding the question , options and the correct option etc.

we used MERN stack to built this app .
